# FACTAGE-method_Mortality
Using EU-SILC UDB Longitudinal Data for Mortality Analyses

This SAS code and its macros were programmed for the Fairer Active Ageing for Europe (FACTAGE) project. FACTAGE is exploring emerging inequalities associated with longer working lives. It is a Joint Programming Initiative - More Years Better Lives (MYBL) project.

The code is free to use but also at your own responsibility and risk. I am not a professional SAS programmer so many macros could probably be improved. If you use this code please have the curtesy to cite me. (A citation template will follow at a later stage)
